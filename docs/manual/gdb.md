GDB usage
=========

QEMU has a primitive support to work with gdb, so that you can do
'Ctrl-C' while the virtual machine is running and inspect its state.

In order to use gdb, launch qemu with the '-s' option. It will wait for a
gdb connection:

    > qemu -s -kernel arch/i386/boot/bzImage -hda root-2.4.20.img \
           -append "root=/dev/hda"
    Connected to host network interface: tun0
    Waiting gdb connection on port 1234

Then launch gdb on the 'vmlinux' executable:

    > gdb vmlinux

In gdb, connect to QEMU:

    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234

Then you can use gdb normally. For example, type 'c' to launch the kernel:

    (gdb) c

Here are some useful tips in order to use gdb on system code:

 * Use *info reg* to display all the CPU registers.
 * Use *x/10i $eip* to display the code at the PC position.
 * Use *set architecture i8086* to dump 16 bit code. Then use
   *x/10i $cs\*16+$eip* to dump the code at the PC position.

Advanced debugging options:

The default single stepping behavior is step with the IRQs and timer service
routines off.  It is set this way because when gdb executes a single step it
expects to advance beyond the current instruction.  With the IRQs and and timer
service routines on, a single step might jump into the one of the interrupt or
exception vectors instead of executing the current instruction. This means you
may hit the same breakpoint a number of times before executing the instruction
gdb wants to have executed.  Because there are rare circumstances where you
want to single step into an interrupt vector the behavior can be controlled
from GDB.  There are three commands you can query and set the single step
behavior:

 * maintenance packet qqemu.sstepbits

   This will display the MASK bits used to control the single stepping IE:

       (gdb) maintenance packet qqemu.sstepbits
       sending: "qqemu.sstepbits"
       received: "ENABLE=1,NOIRQ=2,NOTIMER=4"

 * maintenance packet qqemu.sstep

   This will display the current value of the mask used when single stepping IE:

       (gdb) maintenance packet qqemu.sstep
       sending: "qqemu.sstep"
       received: "0x7"

 * maintenance packet Qqemu.sstep=HEX_VALUE

   This will change the single step mask, so if wanted to enable IRQs on the
   single step, but not timers, you would use:

       (gdb) maintenance packet Qqemu.sstep=0x5
       sending: "qemu.sstep=0x5"
       received: "OK"
