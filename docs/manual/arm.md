ARM System emulator
===================

Use the executable *qemu-system-arm* to simulate a ARM machine. The ARM
Integrator/CP board is emulated with the following devices:

 * ARM926E, ARM1026E, ARM946E, ARM1136 or Cortex-A8 CPU
 * Two PL011 UARTs
 * SMC 91c111 Ethernet adapter
 * PL110 LCD controller
 * PL050 KMI with PS/2 keyboard and mouse.
 * PL181 MultiMedia Card Interface with SD card.

The ARM Versatile baseboard is emulated with the following devices:

 * ARM926E, ARM1136 or Cortex-A8 CPU
 * PL190 Vectored Interrupt Controller
 * Four PL011 UARTs
 * SMC 91c111 Ethernet adapter
 * PL110 LCD controller
 * PL050 KMI with PS/2 keyboard and mouse.
 * PCI host bridge.  Note the emulated PCI bridge only provides access to PCI
   memory space.  It does not provide access to PCI IO space.  This means some
   devices (eg. ne2k_pci NIC) are not usable, and others (eg. rtl8139 NIC) are
   only usable when the guest drivers use the memory mapped control registers.
 * PCI OHCI USB controller.
 * LSI53C895A PCI SCSI Host Bus Adapter with hard disk and CD-ROM devices.
 * PL181 MultiMedia Card Interface with SD card.

Several variants of the ARM RealView baseboard are emulated,
including the EB, PB-A8 and PBX-A9.  Due to interactions with the
bootloader, only certain Linux kernel configurations work out
of the box on these boards.

Kernels for the PB-A8 board should have CONFIG_REALVIEW_HIGH_PHYS_OFFSET
enabled in the kernel, and expect 512M RAM.  Kernels for The PBX-A9 board
should have CONFIG_SPARSEMEM enabled, CONFIG_REALVIEW_HIGH_PHYS_OFFSET
disabled and expect 1024M RAM.

The following devices are emulated:

 * ARM926E, ARM1136, ARM11MPCore, Cortex-A8 or Cortex-A9 MPCore CPU
 * ARM AMBA Generic/Distributed Interrupt Controller
 * Four PL011 UARTs
 * SMC 91c111 or SMSC LAN9118 Ethernet adapter
 * PL110 LCD controller
 * PL050 KMI with PS/2 keyboard and mouse
 * PCI host bridge
 * PCI OHCI USB controller
 * LSI53C895A PCI SCSI Host Bus Adapter with hard disk and CD-ROM devices
 * PL181 MultiMedia Card Interface with SD card.

Options
-------

The following options are specific to the ARM emulation:

 * -semihosting

Enable semihosting syscall emulation.

On ARM this implements the "Angel" interface.

Note that this allows guest direct access to the host filesystem,
so should only be used with trusted guest OS.
