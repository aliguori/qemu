During the graphical emulation, you can use special key combinations to change
modes. The default key mappings are shown below, but if you use *-alt-grab*
then the modifier is Ctrl-Alt-Shift (instead of Ctrl-Alt) and if you use
*-ctrl-grab* then the modifier is the right Ctrl key (instead of Ctrl-Alt):

 * __Ctrl-Alt-f__ Toggle full screen
 * __Ctrl-Alt-+__ Enlarge the screen
 * __Ctrl-Alt--__ Shrink the screen
 * __Ctrl-Alt-u__ Restore the screen's un-scaled dimensions
 * __Ctrl-Alt-n__ Switch to virtual console 'n'. Standard console mappings are:
   - __1__ Target system display
   - __2__ Monitor
   - __3__ Serial port
 * __Ctrl-Alt__ Toggle mouse and keyboard grab.
 * __Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down, Ctrl-PageUp, Ctrl-PageDown__

In the virtual consoles, you can use Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down, Ctrl-PageUp and
Ctrl-PageDown to move in the back log.

 * __Ctrl-a h__ During emulation, if you are using the *-nographic* option, use
   *Ctrl-a h* to get terminal commands:
 * __Ctrl-a ?__ Print this help
 * __Ctrl-a x__ Exit emulator
 * __Ctrl-a s__ Save disk data back to file (if -snapshot)
 * __Ctrl-a t__ Toggle console timestamps
 * __Ctrl-a b__ Send break (magic sysrq in Linux)
 * __Ctrl-a c__ Switch between console and monitor
 * __Ctrl-a a__ Send Ctrl-a
