/**
 * SECTION:object.h
 * @title:Base Object Type System
 * @short_description: interfaces for creating new types and objects
 *
 * The QEMU Object Model provides a framework for registering user creatable
 * types and instantiating objects from those types.  QOM provides the following
 * features:
 *
 *  - System for dynamically registering types
 *  - Support for single-inheritance of types
 *  - Multiple inheritance of stateless interfaces
 *
 * <example>
 *   <title>Creating a minimal type</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 * #include "qdev.h"
 *
 * #define TYPE_MY_DEVICE "my-device"
 *
 * typedef struct MyDevice
 * {
 *     DeviceState parent;
 *
 *     int reg0, reg1, reg2;
 * } MyDevice;
 *
 * static TypeInfo my_device_info = {
 *     .name = TYPE_MY_DEVICE,
 *     .parent = TYPE_DEVICE,
 *     .instance_size = sizeof(MyDevice),
 * };
 *
 * static void my_device_module_init(void)
 * {
 *     type_register_static(&my_device_info);
 * }
 *
 * device_init(my_device_module_init);
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * In the above example, we create a simple type that is described by #TypeInfo.
 * #TypeInfo describes information about the type including what it inherits
 * from, the instance and class size, and constructor/destructor hooks.
 *
 * Every type has an #ObjectClass associated with it.  #ObjectClass derivatives
 * are instantiated dynamically but there is only ever one instance for any
 * given type.  The #ObjectClass typically holds a table of function pointers
 * for the virtual methods implemented by this type.
 *
 * Using object_new(), a new #Object derivative will be instantiated.  You can
 * cast an #Object to a subclass (or base-class) type using
 * object_dynamic_cast().  You typically want to define a macro wrapper around
 * object_dynamic_cast_assert() to make it easier to convert to a specific type.
 *
 * # Class Initialization #
 *
 * Before an object is initialized, the class for the object must be
 * initialized.  There is only one class object for all instance objects
 * that is created lazily.
 *
 * Classes are initialized by first initializing any parent classes (if
 * necessary).  After the parent class object has initialized, it will be
 * copied into the current class object and any additional storage in the
 * class object is zero filled.
 *
 * The effect of this is that classes automatically inherit any virtual
 * function pointers that the parent class has already initialized.  All
 * other fields will be zero filled.
 *
 * Once all of the parent classes have been initialized, #TypeInfo::class_init
 * is called to let the class being instantiated provide default initialize for
 * it's virtual functions.
 *
 * # Interfaces #
 *
 * Interfaces allow a limited form of multiple inheritance.  Instances are
 * similar to normal types except for the fact that are only defined by
 * their classes and never carry any state.  You can dynamically cast an object
 * to one of its #Interface types and vice versa.

 * always begins at byte 0 of that structure, as long as any sub-object places
 * its parent as the first member, we can cast directly to a #Object.
 *
 * As a result, #Object contains a reference to the objects type as its
 * first member.  This allows identification of the real type of the object at
 * run time.
 *
 * #Object also contains a list of #Interfaces that this object

 *   @instance_size is 0, then the size of the object will be the size of the
 *   parent object.
 * @instance_init: This function is called to initialize an object.  The parent
 *   class will have already been initialized so the type is only responsible
 *   for initializing its own members.
 * @instance_finalize: This function is called during object destruction.  This
 *   is called before the parent @instance_finalize function has been called.
 *   An object should only free the members that are unique to its type in this
 *   function.
 * @abstract: If this field is true, then the class is considered abstract and
 *   cannot be directly instantiated.
 * @class_size: The size of the class object (derivative of #ObjectClass)
 *   for this object.  If @class_size is 0, then the size of the class will be
 *   assumed to be the size of the parent class.  This allows a type to avoid
 *   implementing an explicit class type if they are not adding additional
 *   virtual functions.
 * @class_init: This function is called after all parent class initialization
 *   has occured to allow a class to set its default virtual method pointers.  
 *   This is also the function to use to override virtual methods from a parent
 *   class.
 * @class_finalize: This function is called during class destruction and is
 *   meant to release and dynamic parameters allocated by @class_init.
 * @class_data: Data to pass to the @class_init and @class_finalize functions.
 *   This can be useful when building dynamic classes.
 * @interfaces: The list of interfaces associated with this type.  This
 *   should point to a static array that's terminated with a zero filled
